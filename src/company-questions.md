When interviewing for a software developer position, below are some of the questions that are helpful to ask. These should help to guage the company's tech prowess and direction. Below I have listed the questions in loose order of importance. The _Curiosity_ section are less important questions that are not as critical for which to get answers.

### Questions
#### Important
1. Would I be supporting legacy software (old tech) or building greenfield products (new tech)?
1. What is your emphasis on work-life-balance (9-5, weekend work)?
1. Does your team test your software (unit, integration, end-to-end, TDD)?
1. Do you allow for innovation/training time in a regular work week?
1. What software do you use for agentic AI (do you write code manually)?
1. Do you have a dedicated designer/design team?
1. How do you plan the architecture for new application features/components?
1. How much time do you spend each day/week in meetings?
1. Do you provide hardware (Mac/PC, Monitors, test devices)?
1. Will there be any leadership opportunities?
1. Do you use Agile methodologies (scrum, kanban, product owner, project manager, etc)?
1. What is your git workflow (trunk-based, git flow, feature flags)?

#### Curiosity
* What do you do for DevOps (CI/CD)?
* How do you measure ticket size?
* Do you have coding standards?
* How do the designers work with the development team?
* Are there different experience levels on your team (Junior, Senior, Principle, Architect, etc)?
* How much time do you spend working on production issues?
* Do you do pair programming?
